# cpp-algorithims-practice
This repositrory contains algorithmic problems I solved while learning from  programming courses.
These problems help me train my thinking, deepen my understanding of C++, and sharpen my problem-solving skills.
Through many solutions are based on the course, I sometimes adjust function names or parameters to reflect my own style and understanding.
Each file is more than just code -- it is a part of ny personal journey into the world of programming.
